    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
      As a fresh graduate in Information Technology, my goal is to begin my
      professional journey in your company IT department where I can apply my
      academic knowledge, develop new skills, and gain valuable hands-on
      experience. I am eager to learn from experienced professionals, take on
      new challenges, and grow both personally and professionally. With a strong
      motivation to contribute to the success of the team, I aim to become an
      effective part of your organization by supporting IT operations, adapting
      to emerging technologies, and continuously improving my technical and
      problem-solving abilities.
